    <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p> My name is Brandon Burchfield and I live in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>

    <h2> About me </h2>
      <p> After finishing my service in the United States Navy I became a technician for rental equipment. After years of turning wrenches I had decided it was time to make a career change. While many careers jumped out at me, none more than web development.</p>

      <p> Now a student at thinkful, I couldn't be more excited to learn and start this journey!</p>

      <p> Other interests I have outside of developing would be: <ul>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Hockey</li>
        <li>Hanging out with friends</li> 
                </ul> 
                  </p>
